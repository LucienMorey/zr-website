		<h2>Detailed Information</h2>
		<p>The competition is run over many phases that are designed to build up participants knowledge and expertise. Firstly, the Australian Qualifying Competition is run to get students and teachers accustomed to the way that Zero Robotics works. This includes familiarisation with the website and IDE as well as making sure teams are organised in an effective way to ensure a productive and inclusive learning environment.</p>
		<p>The competition will launch on the 10th of May in 2018 with a Kick-off event at The University of Sydney. On the same day the game manual will be released detailing the rules of this year’s game and the requirements to qualify for the International Competition. Initially spaceSPHERES will be played in 2D, teams may submit code at any time after the competition begins on the 10th of May. As listed above the first deadline requires teams to submit some documents that outline the team structure and a <a href="gantt_template.xlsx" target="_blank">gantt chart</a> that maps out the timeline teams have come up with in order to complete the competition. This can include dates for when parts of the team’s code or strategy will be finalised, targets for tutorial completion or other specific learning goals your team comes up with.</p>
		<p>To submit your team’s documents email zero-robotics.admin@sydney.edu.au with the following:</p>

One email per team 
Attach a PDF version of your team structure and Gantt chart in ONE document 
Call the file ‘ zr_planning_docs_SCHOOL_TEAMNAME.pdf ’ where SCHOOL and TEAMNAME are your school and team name respectively 
The email subject line will be the same as the name of the PDF containing your planning documents

		<p>The next deadline is the First Code Submission. This is the deadline for teams to have submitted some piece of working code that scores points. Teams are strongly encouraged to submit code AS OFTEN AS THEY ADD ANYTHING TO THEIR TEAM’S CODE, this deadline is simply the latest date for teams to submit their first piece of code. We say this a lot but SUBMIT EARLY SUBMIT OFTEN is the best strategy for Zero Robotics. </p>
		<p>The Final Code Submission is the deadline for all code submission for the Qualifying Competition. After this date at midnight no submissions will be excepted. </p>
		<p>In order to be entered into the International Competition teams must have passed the three above outlined submission criteria, i.e. submitted planning documents, met the first code submission deadline and submitted another working version of their code that is different to their original version. The 30% of teams will be admitted automatically, however the Venn diagram of teams that meet the above criteria and those who perform well tends to look very circular! </p>
		<p>If teams have a valid reason for not meeting these criteria and can show that they have been working through tutorials and improving their skills they may also be entered in the International Competition. </p>
		<p>After the first code submission teams will have the option to continue playing the competition in 2D or change and begin to play in 3D. For new teams this can be a challenging step and we encourage you to have a go early. There is however plenty of time between the Qualifying Competition and the International Competition if your team does not feel ready to make the change. The teams that wish to change will have their points transferred to a new leader board and the 2D leader board will be organised accordingly. </p>
