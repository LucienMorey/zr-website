                    Zero Robotics is a coding competition for high school students
                    that takes place aboard the International Space Station. Teams
                    of students program NASA research robots (called SPHERES) to
                    participate in an international programming and robotics
                    competition.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Early rounds of the competition are played on
                    NASA's simulator, but the final round of competition is played
                    in space aboard the International Space Station. Since they are
                    dealing with real systems students have to handle uncertainties in
                    operation, code size limitations, and other real world engineering
                    problems.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Thanks to a collaboration between MIT, NASA and The University
                    of Sydney we are proud to provide Zero Robotics to all
                    Australian schools free of charge!

                </span>
                <span class="a">
                    No. They are writing autonomous code.
                    Like a self driving car, once they've finished
                    coding it, the robots will run on their own.

                <span class="a">
                    Students need to know the basics,
                    including coding logic, if statements, loops, functions.
                    Zero Robotics is in C and we recommend that students have
                    used C, Python, Java or similar languages in the past.
                    We will not stop less experienced teams from entering -
                    but be prepared for a steep learning curve!

                    5-20 students per team. If you have less, email us, and

                    Yes, you need to log into the MIT website with an email
                    linked to a google account. Some NSW det email addresses
                    are linked to an account, some aren't.

                <span class="a">
                    We recommend that you use a collaboration tool, since most
                    of the students' work will be done outside of the classroom.
                    Slack is one example, and it is used by engineering teams in
                    industry. Please note that Slack, and many similar pieces of
                    software, are blocked by many school firewalls.

                    it may take a few days for them to be added to the system.
                    Please contact us if you are still having trouble after a
                    few days. Please note you don't need to be logged in to
                    work on your code, only to submit.

                    The structure of the Zero Robotics competition was
                    inspired by FRC. However, unlike FRC, Zero Robotics
                    is totally free, doesn't require specialised equipment
                    and spaces, and allows the students to interface with
                    an advanced NASA research robot - in space.
